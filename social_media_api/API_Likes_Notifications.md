## Supported Notification Types
- New followers
- Likes on posts
- Comments on posts

**How It Works:**  
- Users can like or unlike posts.  
- Post owners receive a notification when someone else likes their post.  
- Notifications are displayed via `/notifications/` endpoint, with unread ones shown first.

## Benefits
- Drives engagement and interaction
- Users stay informed about whatâ€™s happening around their content

## Testing
- Use Django's test client or Postman to send requests to the endpoints.
- Automated tests cover liking, unliking, and notification creation.
