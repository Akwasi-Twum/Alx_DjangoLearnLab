Hereâ€™s a concise guide to complete your Introduction to Django Development Environment Setup:

### 1. Install Django
- Ensure Python is installed:  
  Run `python --version` in your terminal.
- Install Django via pip:  
  ```
  pip install django
  ```

### 2. Create Your Django Project
- Create a new project named `LibraryProject`:  
  ```
  django-admin startproject LibraryProject
  ```

### 3. Run the Development Server
- Navigate to the project directory:  
  ```
  cd LibraryProject
  ```
- Create a `README.md` file inside `LibraryProject`:
  ```
  echo "# LibraryProject" > README.md
  ```
- Start the server:
  ```
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
- Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see the Django welcome page.

### 4. Explore the Project Structure
- **settings.py:** Contains configuration for your Django project (database settings, installed apps, etc.).
- **urls.py:** Manages URL declarations for your project, acting as the routing table.
- **manage.py:** Utility for administrative tasks (running the server, migrations, etc.).
